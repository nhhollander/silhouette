# Silhouette Engine

Silhouette is a basic 3D engine written in OpenGL.  I started work on Silhouette
in the summer of 2017 with a series of experiments in Vulkan and OpenGL, from
which I leared a considerable amount of my knowledge about 3D graphics.  Since
the original inception of this project, it has been cut down and re-built from
the ground up several times, generally as a result of fundamental issues that
could not be solved without re-writing a majority of the codebase.

## Building

Silhouette depends on the following libraries:

1. <TODO>
2. <TODO>
3. <TODO>

### Building on Linux

To build, enter the root directory of the project and run `make`.

### Buildling on other platforms

At this time, building is not supported on other platforms.
